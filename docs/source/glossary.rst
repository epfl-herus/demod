   appliance
      A device designed to perform a domestic task.
      In Demod appliances consume energy from different sources
      (electricity, hot water, gaz, ... )

   household
      Represent one or several persons living in the same dwelling.

   bottom-up models
      "Bottom-Up Model is a system design approach where parts of the
      system are defined in details. Once these parts are designed and
      developed, then these parts or components are linked together to
      prepare a bigger component. This approach is repeated until the
      complete system is built. Advantage of Bottom-Up Model is in making
      decisions at very low level and to decide the re-usability of
      components."

   TPMs
      Transition probablity matrix defines the probability of a simuulated
      component in a MArkov chain of channging from on state to another.
      In demod, TPMs (transition probability matrices) are a set of TPM
      that remebers how the matrices evolve with time.
      By convention, the i-eth TPM define the probabilities for transition from
      state i-1 to i.
