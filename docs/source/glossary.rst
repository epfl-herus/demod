    bottom-up models
        "Bottom-Up Model is a system design approach where parts of the
        system are defined in details. Once these parts are designed and
        developed, then these parts or components are linked together to
        prepare a bigger component. This approach is repeated until the
        complete system is built. Advantage of Bottom-Up Model is in making
        decisions at very low level and to decide the re-usability of
        components."
