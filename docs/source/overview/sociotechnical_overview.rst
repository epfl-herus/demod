Socio-technical modeling
==========================

Before delving into , we would like to stress few points we think are relevant
This point can be used to make more informed choice about the 
most suitable model according to the application, but also encourage 
the improvement of available models.

**Assumptions activities activities**:

- "Time use data represents energy use"
- "Activities transition stochastically"
- "We are all the same"

**Assumptions about technologies**:

- "Appliances are directly linked to activities"
- "Stochastic appliance ownership and use"
- "Appliances are used the same in every home"

**Assumption about service expectation**:

- "Thermal comfort expectation is constant"
- "All other service expectations are stochastic"
